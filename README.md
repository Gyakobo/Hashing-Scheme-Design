# Hashing Scheme Design

Author: [Andrew Gyakobo](https://github.com/Gyakobo)

In this project I'll try to demonstrate a hashing scheme for storing and retrieving data.   

## Introduction

Hearkening from the introduction, we'll be designing a *hash function* which would take in a variety of keys with little to no collision errors between the keys.  

## Methodology

To start off, we'll use a hash function based on a combination of division and multiplication methods. The division method ensures we stay within the address space, and the multiplication method helps distribute the hash values more uniformly.
